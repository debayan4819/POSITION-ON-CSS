Relative Positioning: An element with position: relative; is positioned relative to its normal position. This means you can move it around using the top, right, bottom, and left properties, but it still occupies its original space in the document flow. Other elements will not adjust to fill the space it would have occupied1.
Absolute Positioning: An element with position: absolute; is removed from the normal document flow and positioned relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (an ancestor with a position other than static). If there’s no such ancestor, it positions itself relative to the initial containing block (usually the viewport). It doesn’t leave a gap in the document where it would normally have been located.
